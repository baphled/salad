Salad

Inspired by Cucumber, Salad mixes clients & developers with a little special sauce, created to help bridge the gap between creative minds and developers.

One of the main issues I've come across whilst using Cucumber, is that I end up having to copy and paste various snippets of my existing feature to create new ones. Though Cucumber is a marvelous tool, I still had the need to convert client based specifications into live code.

Salad takes the first step in dealing with this issue. Firstly with Salad it is easy to create features and associate them with projects, building further on them by specifying a features stories and steps need to complete a story.

Imagine, if you will the BS ages, Before Salad, that is. Eating vegetables got boring quite fast, hence us having Salad everywhere, as with vegetables, writing up specs and translating a clients specifications into code can also be boring, leading to mistakes and the most common miscommunication.

Salad makes creating new features & stories easier as you build up a collection, as steps & stories are often reused, Salad gives you the ability to import features, steps & stories into a project, so you don't have to do it all over again. 

This makes Salad a nice simple tool for clarifying feature requirements & rolling out a projects features.
