Salad
</p>
<p>
Inspired by Cucumber, Salad mixes clients &amp; developers with a little
special sauce, created to help bridge the gap between creative minds and
developers.
</p>
<p>
One of the main issues I&#8216;ve come across whilst using Cucumber, is
that I end up having to copy and paste various snippets of my existing
feature to create new ones. Though Cucumber is a marvelous tool, I still
had the need to convert client based specifications into live code.
</p>
<p>
Salad takes the first step in dealing with this issue. Firstly with Salad
it is easy to create features and associate them with projects, building
further on them by specifying a features stories and steps need to complete
a story.
</p>
<p>
Imagine, if you will the BS ages, Before Salad, that is. Eating vegetables
got boring quite fast, hence us having Salad everywhere, as with
vegetables, writing up specs and translating a clients specifications into
code can also be boring, leading to mistakes and the most common
miscommunication.
</p>
<p>
Salad makes creating new features &amp; stories easier as you build up a
collection, as steps &amp; stories are often reused, Salad gives you the
ability to import features, steps &amp; stories into a project, so you
don&#8216;t have to do it all over again.
</p>
<p>
This makes Salad a nice simple tool for clarifying feature requirements
&amp; rolling out a projects features. 1 Features Manage projects &amp;
features Create stories for features Manage a stories steps Export features
